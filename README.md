# divine_gems_webapp

This app was intended for a small business that wants to allow potential users to query thorugh a database full of diamonds. 

Diamonds can be classified by many different features.
- Weight
- Clarity
- Cut
- Color
- Polish
- Symmetry

There are some other different ways that they can be clasified as well, but these are some of the most importnat classifications for diamonds.

The webapp is a MVP for a system that can query by all of these different parameters in a list with approximately 10,000 stones.

Some features, like an authentication and authorizaiton system, are not complete, but the querying system in the backend, along with a pagination system in the frontend can efficiently  sort through all the stones in the list and return a set that matches the user's intended characterisitcs.

There are also some calculations done throughout the API, several instances where the data is restructured so that it can be systematically prepared for the front end to use.

This project was significant for me, because it was a realworld app that also dealt with some type of scale, in this case, a list of 10,000 stones.
